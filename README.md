# Saving-the-Superstore-Analysis
A quick look at which products and sub-categories are the most and least profitable to determine where to focus advertising for greater sales. Also a quick look at return rates for both products and customers to support the findings.

## Key Findings
- Standard shipping for Consumer and Corporate customers generates the most profit.
- Copiers are the sub-category which generates the most profit. Tables are the sub-category responsible for the most loss.
- Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies generate an overall negative profit (loss).
- 3 specific products to stop selling because they generate a loss are: GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System, Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print, and Bush Advantage Collection Racetrack Conference Table. 
- The 3 Best advertising opportunities are Indiana in October, Minnesota in October, and Vermont in November.
- Focus advertising dollars in these states in these months for optimal return.
- All products with a 100% return rate have less than 10 units purchased. With return rate at 100%, these products should stop being sold, especially with less than 10 units purchased.
- There are several customers with a return rate greater than 90%, and 2 customers with a return rate of 100%. Most of these customers have ordered well over 10 items. Reach out to these customers for feedback on their purchase to find what we can improve about our products.
